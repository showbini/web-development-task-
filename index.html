# Web Development Competition Submission

This repository contains my solutions for three Web Development tasks (W1, W2, and W3), focusing on clean code, modern CSS practices, and enhanced user experience beyond the minimum requirements.

## 1. Integrated Solution: W1 (Sign-Up Form) + W2 (Styled Card)

**File:** `w1-w2-signup-card.html`

### Concept: Modern Centered Form

I combined W1 and W2 into a single, cohesive interface. The Sign-Up Form is housed inside a professional, perfectly centered card.

**Key Technical Highlights:**

* **W1 Fulfillment:** Includes fields for Name, Email (`type="email"`), Password (`type="password"`), and Confirm Password (`type="password"`), and a Submit button.
* **W2 Centering (Unique Technique):** Used **CSS Flexbox** (`display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;`) on the body to achieve robust, perfect **horizontal and vertical centering**, which is a modern best practice.
* **W2 Styling:** The card has a defined width and background color, with padding, border-radius, and a subtle box-shadow for a clean aesthetic.

## 2. Solution: W3 (Image and Link Page)

**File:** `w3-links-images.html`

### Concept: Semantic Structure with Interactive Flair

This solution implements the title, paragraph, image, and links, while demonstrating a flair for basic interactive design.

**Key Technical Highlights:**

* **W3 Fulfillment:** Includes all required elements: a `<h1>` title, a `<p>` paragraph, an `<img>` tag (centered and styled), and an `<ul>` list with three links.
* **Styled Links (Unique Technique):** The links are styled with a distinct background and a blue left border. Crucially, they include a **CSS transition and transform** on hover, which causes the link to smoothly change color and move slightly. This showcases understanding of interactivity and simple visual effects.

Do you have your files ready, or would you like me to perform a **quick check** on any specific part of the code before you upload it?
